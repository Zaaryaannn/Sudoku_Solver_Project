# Sudoku_Solver_Project
Designed a user-friendly optimised Sudoku solver in C++ capable of solving puzzles across all difficulty levels 
Leveraged backtracking for Sudoku, exploring solutions through recursive assignment of values to empty cells 
Optimized the solver by changing the assigning function to prioritize cells with the fewest possible values first 
This prioritization significantly reduces unnecessary backtracking steps, leading to a faster and efficient algorithm
